# Tricky Colors

Can you find the winning square?

The goal is to pick the square that has a different color from the rest of the grid. As you progress through levels, the size of the grid increases and the differece between the winning square and the rest of the grid becomes less obvious.
You have 60 seconds to find as many winning squares as possible.
